James' dotfiles
===============

These are my configuration dotfiles and their respective settings. I am inspired by [Zach Holman's passionate exultations on forkable dotfiles][zach] (that sounds so wrong...), and the idea of keeping both a central repository and history strikes my efficiency drive like a hammer to an anvil. I am fired up!

###Installation

There's a lot of other people's code here, and I want to keep it updated regularly and automatically. Thus I make extensive use of `git submodules` so I'm always on the cutting edge. This is especially true with my VIM plugins.

This currently is in very early alpha, so I don't have an easy way to install it yet. I'll be writing a script or something that makes this easier. For the time being, you are on your own...
